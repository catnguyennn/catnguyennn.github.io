        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a second-year psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. I am interested in the brain and people's personalities since people's mental health has changed throughout the years, especially after the pandemic. I also find people's personalities interesting and how they develop from childhood to adulthood.<br><br>
                      I am interested in the brain and people's personalities since people's mental health has changed throughout the years, especially after the pandemic. I have worked with children in the special needs department since I have a sibling with special needs. So, I was inspired by training with my sibling to work in therapy and with children with autism. I would shadow speech pathologists whenever my sibling would have his lessons. I would also attend my siblingâ€™s therapy appointments, which was the spark of my interest in the psychology field. I saw the way the psychologist would listen to my siblingâ€™s concerns and would prescribe medications. My sibling has gone to many years of therapy sessions, and I would shadow the sessions and see how the therapist interacted with my sibling. I would also participate in children's special needs events during the summer. I applied these skills to my research and my everyday life by interacting with friends. I helped with leading the children to their activities and organzing tables. In the event, I learned how to interact with children with all kinds of special needs. I learned patience and leadership skills. I would see how the speech pathologists help my sibling talk normally and interact with others in a social setting so he would not be so overwhelmed. I am also interested in the health department as I want to work in the hospital. I have worked with patients on getting bloodwork and treating patients with different medications. I grew up with doctors and nurses as my parents are healthcare workers, so I always felt inspired to also work in the hospital setting. I volunteered in hospitals and clinics. I have always felt the need to help people, which is why I chose to specialize in the psychology field, as it can help people mentally, and if they have any trauma, they can talk it out instead of a cycle repeating their trauma.<br><br>
                  I also believe that mental health is a significant factor in todayâ€™s day and age since teenagers grew up isolated from the pandemic. The effects of social media and the idealization of how teenagers should look lead to an unrealistic standard, causing teenage girls to become depressed. I do not have that much experience in the field of psychology as I have only taken introductory classes about psychology. Interesting topics in psychology that I have learned about are sleep and how our brain processes and inputs the information we learn throughout the day, which contributes to long-term memory.<br><br>
                  I also learned about research topics such as burnout and how it affects workers in the workplace. I like these topics because of how they reflect our society and how we can apply them to our everyday lives. I am also active, as I like to interact with people. I grew up taking swim lessons and competitions, which helped me gain friends throughout my childhood and high school years.<br><br>
